# Stock market prediction using Artificial Intelligence

These projects are stock market forecasting / decision recommendation robots using AI techniques, using both technical and fundamentalist strategies.

Main Vision in all projects: Simple and accurate > Complex and inaccurate! 

Active Projects - you can check the code being develop in each folder -  If folder == empty then i am fixing bugs or applying optimizations ;)

* Carbon > Classical Machine Learning methods like Supporting Vector Machine (SVM) / Random Forrest Classifier etc. 

* Hydrogen > Artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning topologies/algorithms experiments like Long-Short Term Memory - neural networks (LSTM), Reinforcement Learning, QLearning, A2C, Curiosity Driven etc.

* Oxgygen > NeuroEvolution Augumented Topologies - neural networks (NEAT) topology as a evolutional neural network. Given its particularity i've separated in another special project.

1) IMPORTANT: All codes are under construction =)

2) IMPORTANT 2: Suggestions? Feel free to tell me =) I'd like to learn even more!
